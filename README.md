# AS Ilmokone (Ilmomasiina)

Ilmomasiina is the event registration system originally created by Athene in 2016,
and forked in 2021 by Tietokilta for their new website. AS-guild forked the improved Ilmomasiina
by Tietokilta in 2024 for their own use.
There are [numerous major upgrades](./CHANGELOG.md) from the Athene version made by Tietokilta.

**As this fork is used and modified by AS-guild, please check out
Tietokilta's [original repository](https://github.com/Tietokilta/ilmomasiina) for your own deployment needs.**

## Installation

See [installation.md](docs/installation.md). You can find the setup AS-guild uses
from [as-ilmokone-setup.md](docs/as-ilmokone-setup.md).

## Documentation

See the [documentation](docs/README.md) for more information.

## For developers

Progress and planning is tracked in GitHub issues, but this is
mostly for issues considering AS Ilmokone specifically.

Project boards are used for more targeted and structured development periods.

Tietokilta's [original repository](https://github.com/Tietokilta/ilmomasiina).
